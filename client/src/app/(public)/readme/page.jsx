      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">The Story of Shelfu</h1>

      <p className="text-lg">
        Shelfu started as a simple idea: I wanted a better way to track and
        organize my manga collection. I was tired of notebooks, random
        screenshots, and messy spreadsheets. I wanted something that was
        intuitive, visual, and actually fun to use.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Why I Built Shelfu</h2>
      <p>
        As someone who loves manga, I realized there wasn’t a tool that truly
        matched how I wanted to manage my collection. Existing apps were either
        too cluttered, too limited, or just didn’t feel personal. That’s when I
        decided to build Shelfu: a platform that lets manga enthusiasts like me
        take control of their collection in a way that is both practical and
        beautiful.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Building Shelfu was as much about learning as it was about creating. I
        dived deeper into React, TailwindCSS, and frontend animations. I
        experimented with user-friendly dashboards, responsive designs, and dark
        mode. Every feature, from global search to collection insights, was a
        challenge that pushed me to improve my coding skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along the way, I learned how important it is to think like a user. What
        do people really want from a collection app? How can I make data
        visualization both useful and simple? How do I make the app fast and
        responsive while keeping it visually appealing?
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Design with empathy, understand the user’s pain points.</li>
        <li>Break problems into smaller parts, small victories add up.</li>
        <li>
          Consistency and attention to detail matter, especially in UI/UX.
        </li>
        <li>Never stop learning, each challenge is an opportunity to grow.</li>
        <li>Feedback is gold, watch how users interact and iterate quickly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Shelfu isn’t just an app, it’s a reflection of a personal journey. A
        journey of solving a problem I faced, learning new technologies, and
        creating something that brings joy and value to others. Every feature,
        every line of code, tells a story of growth, curiosity, and passion.
